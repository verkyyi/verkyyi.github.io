    "text": "Narrative Summary\nThis study aims to predict patient outcomes in a clinical trial of multiple myeloma treatments by using predictive analysis and survival analysis. Specifically, the project will focus on two key predictions: - Which patients are likely to experience a complete or partial response to treatment. - Which patients are more prone to adverse events during the treatment period.\nAdditionally, we will use survival analysis to examine how treatment response and adverse events influence progression-free survival (PFS). By integrating predictive and survival analysis, this research will enhance understanding of how patient characteristics and treatment types contribute to outcomes, offering insights into optimizing treatment strategies for multiple myeloma."

Predicting who will respond to therapy and who is at higher risk for adverse events is critical for optimizing treatment plans. By leveraging clinical trial data from the NCT02252172 study, this project will use predictive models to forecast treatment responses and adverse events. Additionally, the study will conduct survival analysis to explore the impact of these predictions on progression-free survival (PFS), a key clinical outcome. The project will contribute to personalized treatment approaches in multiple myeloma, enabling better patient management and improving outcomes."

    "text": "Conclusions\nIn this project, we successfully conducted a comprehensive analysis of progression-free survival (PFS). Since we couldn’t get the actual data one time. We used the synthetic dataset to simulate a standard phase 3 clinical trial data comparing different treatment groups in multiple myeloma patients.\nThrough feature selection using Kaplan-Meier methods, we identified key variables for inclusion in survival models. Using both Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time (AFT) models, we effectively modeled survival differences between the two treatment groups, gaining valuable insights into their relative efficacy.\nAlthough we relied on synthetic data due to pending approval of the actual dataset, this allowed us to simulate real-world analysis scenarios following CDISC standards. While the results are not directly applicable to real-world clinical decision-making, the process familiarized us with industry-standard methodologies and reinforced our ability to conduct robust survival analyses. The approach and techniques we applied can be readily adapted to any available clinical trial dataset, providing a solid foundation for future research.",

Progression-free survival (PFS) is a critical clinical outcome that reflects the effectiveness of therapy in delaying disease progression. This project focuses solely on analyzing PFS using synthetic data modeled on clinical trial NCT02252172, which compared two combination therapies (DRd vs. Rd) in newly diagnosed patients. Due to challenges in obtaining access to the real clinical trial data within the project timeline, synthetic data was generated to emulate the actual dataset’s structure and characteristics. This analysis aims to provide insights into PFS trends and predictors, contributing to personalized treatment strategies for improving patient outcomes in multiple myeloma.\n\n\n\n\nAim 1: Conduct survival analysis to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in multiple myeloma patients receiving DRd or Rd therapies.\nAim 2: Investigate the impact of patient characteristics, biomarkers, and treatment type on PFS using predictive modeling.\nAim 3: Identify key predictors of PFS to inform personalized treatment strategies for patients with multiple myeloma.\n\n\n\n\nThis project focuses on analyzing progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who participated in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial (modeled after NCT02252172).

    "text": "Data Generation Process\nTo generate synthetic data for this project, we began by identifying the relevant datasets from the list of SDTM and ADaM datasets provided in the YODA clinical trial report for NCT02252172. This particular trial included a comprehensive set of datasets that aligned with FDA standards and CDISC data models. Among these datasets, we selected only those directly relevant to progression-free survival (PFS) analysis: adverse events (ADAE), response assessments (RS), laboratory results (LB), demographics (DM), treatment exposure (EX), and subject characteristics (SC). These datasets were chosen because they contained variables critical for modeling PFS and performing survival analysis.\nTo generate the synthetic datasets, we referenced the CDISC SDTM Implementation Guide and the CDISC ADaM Implementation Guide, which provide standardized definitions and structures for clinical trial data. The guides ensured that our synthetic data adhered to FDA data submission standards and retained compatibility with clinical trial data pipelines. Links to these guides are included for reference:\n\nSDTM Implementation Guide: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm\nADaM Implementation Guide: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam\n\nThe synthetic data was designed based on information published in the YODA trial report, clinicaltrials.gov, and CDISC documentation. This approach ensured that the datasets closely resembled the original clinical trial data while maintaining flexibility for exploratory analysis. The generation process was conducted in R, utilizing structured approaches to mimic real-world clinical trial data.\n\nDataset-Specific Generation Details\n\nAdverse Events (ADAE):\n\nSynthetic adverse events were generated with a focus on treatment-emergent events (TRTEMFL = “Y”). The severity of events (AESEV: Mild, Moderate, Severe) was assigned based on predefined probabilities reflecting the distribution observed in similar trials. Serious adverse events (AESER) were conditionally linked to severity, with all severe events marked as serious and mild or moderate events typically marked as non-serious.\nStart (AESTDTC) and end dates (AEENDTC) were generated within the treatment period to ensure temporal alignment.\n\nResponse Assessments (RS):\n\nResponse categories such as “Complete Response,” “Partial Response,” “Stable Disease,” and “Progressive Disease” were generated using probabilities aligned with clinical trial outcome distributions. The results were tied to random response assessment dates within the follow-up period.\n\nLaboratory Results (LB):\n\nLab test codes (e.g., LDH, ALB, HGB) were expanded into wide-format variables, with numeric results generated based on clinical reference ranges (LBSTNRLO and LBSTNRHI). Random noise was added to mimic variability among patients. Baseline lab flags (LBBLFL) were included to identify pre-treatment measurements.\n\nDemographics (DM):\n\nPatient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity) were generated to reflect distributions typical of multiple myeloma trials. For example, the median age was centered around 70 years, with a slight skew toward older patients.\n\nTreatment Exposure (EX):\n\nTreatment assignment (DRd vs. Rd) was randomized with a 1:1 ratio, matching the randomization strategy of the clinical trial. Dose levels (EXDOSE) and treatment start/end dates (EXSTDTC, EXENDTC) were assigned within the trial’s protocol-specified ranges.\n\nSubject Characteristics (SC):\n\nMetrics such as BMI, ECOG performance status, and CRP levels were generated for each patient, with values based on clinical distributions for multiple myeloma patients. For example, ECOG scores ranged from 0 (fully active) to 4 (completely disabled).\n\n\n\n\nMethodology and Biases\nWhile much of the data was generated using random sampling techniques, care was taken to introduce clinically relevant patterns and biases. For example: - Adverse events were more likely to occur in patients with worse ECOG performance status. - Response probabilities were linked to lab biomarker levels, such as higher LDH correlating with poorer outcomes. - Treatment effects were reflected by slightly better PFS outcomes in the DRd arm compared to the Rd arm, consistent with findings reported in the original trial.\nThis synthetic data generation process aimed to balance realism with flexibility, creating datasets suitable for rigorous PFS analysis while avoiding overfitting to specific assumptions or outcomes. By closely following FDA standards and CDISC guidelines, the synthetic data maintains its utility for generalizable clinical research while adhering to regulatory frameworks.",

    "section": "Variable Derivations",
    "text": "Variable Derivations\nIn preparation for the progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, several variables across datasets required derivation and transformation to ensure consistency and compatibility with survival modeling methods such as Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time (AFT) models. Specifically, this involved aggregating datasets like adverse events (ADAE) and transforming laboratory results (LB) and subject characteristics (SC) datasets into a wide format to ensure each row corresponded to one unique subject. Below, we detail the variable derivation process and rationale.\n\nAdverse Events (ADAE)\nThe ADAE dataset originally contained multiple rows per subject, as each row represented a single adverse event. To prepare the dataset for PFS analysis: - Aggregation Process: - Total number of adverse events per subject (TOTAE) was calculated by counting the rows corresponding to each unique subject. - Number of serious adverse events (SAECOUNT) was derived by summing events where the AESER flag was marked as “Y”. - The most severe adverse event (AEDECOD_MS) was identified for each subject, with priority given to events marked as “Severe.” If no severe events existed, the next most severe category (e.g., “Moderate” or “Mild”) was selected. - Rationale: Aggregating ADAE was necessary to ensure that the survival models, which require one subject per row, could incorporate adverse event data as predictors.\n\n# Aggregate ADAE to one row = one patient as opposed to one row = one adverse event for a patient\naggregated_adae &lt;- adae_data %&gt;%\n  filter(TRTEMFL == \"Y\") %&gt;% # Keep only treatment-emergent adverse events\n  group_by(USUBJID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    TOTAE = n(), # Total number of adverse events per patient\n    SAECOUNT = sum(AESER == \"Y\"), # Count of serious adverse events\n    AEDECOD_MS = case_when(\n      any(AESEV == \"Severe\") ~ AEDECOD[which(AESEV == \"Severe\")[1]],\n      any(AESEV == \"Moderate\") ~ AEDECOD[which(AESEV == \"Moderate\")[1]],\n      any(AESEV == \"Mild\") ~ AEDECOD[which(AESEV == \"Mild\")[1]],\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    AEBODSYS = first(AEBODSYS), # Take the first occurrence as a representative\n    AESEV = first(AESEV), # Take the first severity reported\n    AESER = first(AESER),\n    AESTDTC = first(AESTDTC), \n    AEENDTC = first(AEENDTC)\n  ) \n\n\n\nLaboratory Results (LB) and Subject Characteristics (SC)\nBoth the LB and SC datasets contained multiple rows per subject, with each row representing different test results (e.g., LDH, ALB, HGB for LB or BMI, ECOG, CRP for SC). These datasets were transformed into wide format: - Transformation Process: - The datasets were pivoted from long to wide format, creating separate columns for each test or characteristic. - For LB: Columns such as LDH, ALB, and HGB were created, populated by their respective values (LBSTRESN). - For SC: Columns such as BMI, ECOG, and CRP were created, populated by their respective values (SCSTRESN). - Irrelevant columns, such as test dates (LBDTC and SCDTC) and baseline flags (LBBLFL), were removed to simplify the datasets and focus on the numeric results for each test or characteristic. - Rationale: The wide format allowed laboratory biomarker levels and subject characteristics to be included directly as predictors in survival models. This transformation ensured compatibility with the one-row-per-subject structure while maintaining meaningful clinical variables.\n\n# Reshape lb_data into wide format\nlb_data_wide &lt;- lb_data %&gt;%\n  select(-LBDTC, -LBBLFL, -LBSTNRLO, -LBSTNRHI) %&gt;% # Remove unwanted columns\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = LBTESTCD, # Use the test codes (LDH, ALB, HGB) as new column names\n    values_from = LBSTRESN # Fill these columns with their corresponding numeric values\n  )\n\n\n# Reshape sc_data into wide format\nsc_data_wide &lt;- sc_data %&gt;%\n  select(-SCDTC) %&gt;% # Remove the SCDTC column\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = SCTESTCD, # Use SCTESTCD categories (BMI, ECOG, CRP) as new column names\n    values_from = SCSTRESN # Fill these columns with their corresponding numeric values\n  )\n\n\n\nOther Derivations\n\nDemographics (DM): Variables such as age (AGE) and performance status (ECOG) were used as-is but were carefully reviewed for completeness and consistency across subjects.\nResponse Assessments (RS): The best overall response category (RSSTRESC) was included without additional derivation, as it directly aligned with the PFS endpoint.\n\n\n\nImportance of Derivation for PFS Analysis\nThe process of aggregating and deriving variables was a critical step in preparing the data for Cox proportional hazards and AFT models. Both methods require that each subject’s data is represented in a single row, with variables corresponding to patient characteristics, biomarker values, treatment information, and adverse event summaries. Without these derivations and transformations, the datasets would have been incompatible with the modeling requirements, leading to potential errors or loss of analytical rigor.\nBy deriving and aggregating variables as described, the data was standardized and made suitable for robust statistical analysis, ensuring that key predictors for PFS were accurately represented. This also enhanced the interpretability of the models by summarizing complex datasets into clinically meaningful variables.",

    "text": "Data Merging\nTo prepare the dataset for progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, we merged multiple clinical trial datasets, ensuring that the resulting dataset provided a comprehensive and consistent view of each subject. The goal of the merging process was to combine relevant data from various sources while maintaining a single row per subject to align with the requirements of survival analysis models such as Cox proportional hazards and AFT models.\n\nMerging Strategy\nThe merging process focused on the following datasets: - ADTTE (Time-to-Event Analysis): Provided key time-to-event variables such as STARTDT, ADT, and CNSR. - RS (Response Assessments): Captured overall response categories (RSSTRESC). - ADAE (Adverse Events): Included derived features such as the total number of adverse events (TOTAE), serious adverse events (SAECOUNT), and the most severe adverse event (AEDECOD_MS). - DM (Demographics): Provided patient characteristics such as AGE, SEX, RACE, and ETHNIC. - LB (Laboratory Results): Offered key biomarker variables such as LDH, ALB, and HGB in wide format. - EX (Exposure): Included treatment details such as EXTRT and EXDOSE. - SC (Subject Characteristics): Contained subject-specific variables like BMI, ECOG, and CRP in wide format.\nThe datasets were merged sequentially using USUBJID as the key identifier. This ensured that each subject’s data from different sources was linked accurately, resulting in a unified dataset that captured all necessary variables for PFS analysis.\n\n\nFeature Reduction\nAfter merging, the initial dataset contained 53 features. To streamline the analysis and focus on variables relevant to modeling, we reduced the dataset to 27 features. The reduction process involved: 1. Retaining Key Variables: Only variables essential for PFS modeling were kept, including time-to-event data, treatment information, patient characteristics, biomarkers, and derived variables. 2. Excluding Redundant Features: Redundant columns, such as multiple study identifiers and variables with overlapping information, were removed. 3. Ensuring Model Compatibility: Variables unrelated to PFS or unlikely to influence the outcome (e.g., administrative or descriptive features) were excluded to simplify the dataset and reduce noise.\n\n\nResulting Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n\nThe synthesized dataset is available at https://github.com/gu-dsan6150/fall-2024-project-team-03/tree/main/data\n\n\nThe resulting cleaned dataset includes key predictors and outcomes relevant for PFS analysis, such as treatment assignment (TRT01P), biomarkers (LDH, ALB, HGB), adverse event summaries (TOTAE, SAECOUNT, AEDECOD_MS), and demographics (AGE, SEX, RACE, ETHNIC). This streamlined dataset is well-suited for survival analysis and ensures consistency across all variables while maintaining the analytical rigor required for the study.\nThe data merging and feature reduction steps played a critical role in preparing a clean and robust dataset for modeling, aligning with the goals of the project to predict and analyze PFS outcomes in multiple myeloma patients.",

    "text": "Model Summary Interpretation\n\nCoefficients\n\nA positive coefficient suggests that the hazard increases with the covariate (e.g., higher TOTAE is associated with higher risk).\nA negative coefficient suggests that the hazard decreases with the covariate (e.g., one treatment plan may reduces risk).\n\n\n\nHazard Ratio\n\nRepresents the hazard ratio (HR), which quantifies the effect of a covariate on the hazard rate.\n\nHR &gt; 1: Covariate increases the hazard (worse survival).\nHR &lt; 1: Covariate decreases the hazard (better survival).\n\nFor example:\n\nTOTAE: IF HR = 1.1, A 1-unit increase in adverse events decrease the hazard by 10%.\nTreatment B: IF HR = 0.84. Treatment B reduces the hazard by 16% (1 - 0.84) compared to the reference group (Treatment A).\n\n\n\n\nConcordance Index (C-Index)\nThe concordance statistic (C-index) measures the model’s predictive accuracy: Values range from 0.5 (no predictive ability) to 1.0 (perfect prediction).\nThe concordance index is 0.56, which indicates that the model is slightly better than random chance.\n\n\nVisualize the proportional hazards assumption check\nThis computes the Schoenfeld residuals for the Cox model to test whether the proportional hazards assumption holds for each covariate.\nThe test evaluates if the effect of each covariate on the hazard ratio changes over time.\nA significant change indicates a violation of the proportional hazards assumption.\n\n\nCode\nplot(cox.zph(cox_model))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points to Look For\n\nFlat Line at 0: Suggests the proportional hazards assumption holds.\nUpward/Downward Trends: Indicates potential time-varying effects of the covariate, violating the proportional hazards assumption.\nRandom Fluctuations: Small random fluctuations around 0 are normal and not concerning.\n\nFollow-Up Actions if Assumption is Violated\nIf a covariate shows a significant violation: 1. Time-Dependent Covariates: Consider modeling the covariate as time-dependent (e.g., using interaction terms or tt() in coxph). 2. Stratification: Use stratified Cox models (strata()) to handle covariates that violate the proportional hazards assumption. 3. Alternative Models: Consider other survival models, such as the accelerated failure time (AFT) model.\n\n\nDoing Adjusted Survival Curves\nAdjusted survival curves are used in Cox proportional hazards models to visualize the survival probabilities while accounting for the effects of covariates. They present survival estimates that are adjusted for the average or specific values of covariates, allowing a more accurate comparison between groups (e.g., treatment groups).\n\n\nCode\n# Fix Covarites\n# Plot the adjusted survival curves for specific predictors:\n# generated new data with the features set as the mean of the data other than TRT01P\nnewdata &lt;- data.frame(\n  TRT01P = c(\"TREAT A\", \"TREAT B\"),\n  TOTAE = mean(data$TOTAE, na.rm = TRUE),\n  LDH = mean(data$LDH),\n  ECOG = mean(data$ECOG),\n  ALB = mean(data$ALB),\n  HGB = mean(data$HGB),\n  # get the most common value of SEX\n  SEX = names(sort(table(data$SEX), decreasing = TRUE))[1]\n)\nnewdata\n\n\n\nA data.frame: 2 x 7\n\n\nTRT01P\nTOTAE\nLDH\nECOG\nALB\nHGB\nSEX\n\n\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTREAT A\n2.462185\n56.09367\n2.030252\n56.42446\n54.72755\nMale\n\n\nTREAT B\n2.462185\n56.09367\n2.030252\n56.42446\n54.72755\nMale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#  compute survival probabilities for the levels of your predictor of interes\nsurv_curves &lt;- survfit(cox_model, newdata = newdata)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## Plot the Adjusted Survival Curves\nggsurvplot(\n  surv_curves,\n  data = data,\n  conf.int = TRUE,               # Add confidence intervals\n  legend.title = \"Treatment\",    # Title for the legend\n  legend.labs = c(\"TREAT A\", \"TREAT B\"),  # Labels for levels of treatment\n  xlab = \"Time (days)\",\n  ylab = \"Survival Probability\",\n  title = \"Adjusted Survival Curves by Treatment\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n### ADD AIC Score Calculation\n\n# Calculate the AIC score\n\naic &lt;- AIC(cox_model)\naic\n\n\n4379.89116625287",

In this section, we are trying to use different combinations of variables and use them in AFT model to see if we can get any significant variables in these combinations and which combination makes the model better. We will start with only TOTAE First.\n\n\nCode\n#AFT Model\nm1&lt;- survreg(Surv(AVAL,1-CNSR) ~  TOTAE  , \n    data = d_s )\ntidy(m1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   6.63      0.0551    120.   0       \n2 TOTAE        -0.0248    0.0190     -1.31 1.91e- 1\n3 Log(scale)   -0.625     0.0417    -15.0  8.93e-51\n\n\nFrom the result above, the TOTAE column is not significant(p-value greater than 0.05) when using it in a AFT model by itself. Now we want to find the combinations of variables that makes a model a good fit for the data.\n\n\nCode\ncandidate_vars &lt;- c(\"TRT01P\", \"TOTAE\", \"SAECOUNT\",\"AEDECOD_MS\",\"AEBODSYS\",\"AESER\",\"AGE\",\"SEX\",\"RACE\",\"ETHNIC\",\"LDH\",\"ALB\",\"HGB\",\"BMI\",\"ECOG\",\"CRP\")\n\nmodel_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Generate all combinations of the candidate variables (from 1 to n variables)\ncombos &lt;- lapply(1:length(candidate_vars), function(n) combn(candidate_vars, n, simplify = FALSE))\n\n# Flatten the list of combinations\ncombos &lt;- unlist(combos, recursive = FALSE)\n\n# Initialize the base model (just the intercept)\nbase_model &lt;- survreg(Surv(AVAL, 1-CNSR) ~ 1, data = d_s, dist = \"weibull\")\n\n# Fit models for each combination of variables\nfor (i in 1:length(combos)) {\n  # Create the formula for the combination of variables\n  combo_formula &lt;- paste(\"Surv(AVAL, 1-CNSR) ~\", paste(combos[[i]], collapse = \" + \"))\n  \n  # Fit the model\n  new_model &lt;- survreg(as.formula(combo_formula), data = d_s, dist = \"weibull\")\n  \n  # Store the model in model_list\n  model_list[[i]] &lt;- new_model\n  \n}\n\nlength(combos)\n\n\nAs you can see, there are 65535 combinations of variables. Now we want to get the top ten models that has the lowest AIC scores. AIC score is a criteria that measures how well a statistical model fits the data. Lower AIC indicates better fit.\n\n\nCode\n# Initialize a data frame to store model AICs\naic_scores &lt;- data.frame(\n  model_id = integer(),\n  variables = character(),\n  aic = numeric()\n)\n\n# Calculate the AIC for each model and store the results\nfor (i in seq_along(model_list)) {\n  # Extract the model\n  model &lt;- model_list[[i]]\n  \n  # Get the AIC and variable combination\n  aic &lt;- AIC(model)\n  vars &lt;- paste(attr(model$terms, \"term.labels\"), collapse = \", \")\n  \n  # Append to the data frame\n  aic_scores &lt;- rbind(aic_scores, data.frame(\n    model_id = i,\n    variables = vars,\n    aic = aic\n  ))\n}\n\n# Sort by AIC in ascending order and get the top 10\ntop_10_models &lt;- aic_scores[order(aic_scores$aic), ][1:10, ]\n\n# Print the top 10 models with their AICs\nprint(top_10_models)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfor (i in 1:nrow(top_10_models)) {\n  model_id &lt;- top_10_models$model_id[i]\n  cat(\"\\n\\nSummary of Model\", i, \"with variables:\", top_10_models$variables[i], \"\\n\")\n  print(summary(model_list[[model_id]]))\n}\n\n\n    \nFrom the result above, we can see that the model with only TOTAE as a variable has the lowest AIC score. However, the difference of the AIC scores among the top ten models are not huge. And we don’t see any significant variables among these models. We now want to see the AIC scores of the model with the variables that we selected and check if there are any significant variables in it.\n\n\nCode\n#AFT Model\nm&lt;- survreg(Surv(AVAL,1-CNSR) ~  TRT01P + HGB + TOTAE + SEX + ECOG , \n    data = d_s )\nsummary(m)\n\n\n\nCall:\nsurvreg(formula = Surv(AVAL, 1 - CNSR) ~ TRT01P + HGB + TOTAE + \n    SEX + ECOG, data = d_s)\n                  Value Std.

Based on the reason that we select the features, we believe we can keep our selected model and make interpretation on it.\nFor AFT models, if the coefficient is negative, that means increase in risk which cause the log survive time to decrease. In our result, Among all the variables, only LDH has a positive value, which indicates that every unit increase in LDH, the log of survival time increase by 0.002. The TRT10P has a negative value which indicates that Treatment B decrease the log survival time by 0.04 compare to Treatment A. Being a male also decrease the log survival time by 0.01 compare to being a female. All the other variables indicates ab decrease in log survival time.",
