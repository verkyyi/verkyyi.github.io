    "Hi, everyone! Today I gonna introduce chatbots. We've seen a lot of chatbots in our daily life, like Siri, Alexa, and ChatGpt. But how do they work? How can we build one?\n",

    "So, what can chatbots do? I guess, before ChatGpt, most of you have used chatbots for customer service. For example, when you have questions about your order, you can ask the chatbot. Another example is insurance sales. Lemonade is a famous insurance company that uses chatbots to sell insurance. \n",

    "::: {.notes}\n",
    "So, what is Rasa? You can use this framework to build your own chatbot. It's open source and free. \n",

    "![](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/img/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.notes}\n",
    "So, how does Rasa work? Rasa has two parts. One is the training data, and the other is the runtime. The training data is used to train the model. And the runtime is used to run the model. The training data is composed of intents, responses, rules, and stories. The runtime is composed of NLU, Core, and Action Server. NLU is used to understand the user's intent. Core is used to decide what to do next. And Action Server is used to execute the action.\n",

    "## Response\n",
    "How the bot replies to the query. \n",

    "## Rules\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Story\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.notes}\n",
    "Then, let's talk about stories. Stories are common conversation flows. Beyond rules, this can give more context information to the bot.\n",

    "Besides the above methods, you can also use interactive learning to teach your assistant.\n",
    "It's like teaching a child. You can talk with the bot, and the bot will ask you what to do next.\n",
    "So all the above rules, intents, and responses can be created dynamically while talking with the bot.\n",
